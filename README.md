## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Currency

The application uses the rupee symbol (‚Çπ) in the summary headers in the HTML/CSS, but the JavaScript logic and all numerical displays are hardcoded to show the dollar sign (**$**) for simplicity and consistency in the code, using the `formatCurrency` function. If you need to change the displayed currency, modify the following lines in the `<script>` tag:

* **`updateSummary` function:** Change `$` in the `textContent` lines.
* **`createExpenseCard` function:** Change `$` in the card template strings.
